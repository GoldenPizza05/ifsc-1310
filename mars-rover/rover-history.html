    <p>The Mars Rover Program is a series of missions led primarily by NASA with the goal of exploring the surface of Mars using robotic rovers. 
    These missions aim to investigate the Martian terrain, geology, climate, and potential for past or present life. 
    The program is a key part of NASA's long-term strategy for planetary exploration and preparation for eventual human missions to Mars.</p>

    <p>Since the late 20th century, several Mars rovers have been launched, each building on the successes and lessons of its predecessors. 
    The program began with small-scale exploratory missions and has progressed to highly sophisticated scientific operations. Key missions include:</p>
    
    <ul> 
    <li>Sojourner (1997): Part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, Sojourner was the first successful rover on Mars. 
    It demonstrated basic mobility and remote control capabilities and provided valuable data on Martian soil and atmosphere.

    <li>Spirit and Opportunity (2004): These twin rovers were part of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission. 
    They vastly exceeded their expected lifespans and made significant discoveries, including evidence of ancient water flows on Mars.</li>

    <li></li>Curiosity (2012–present): Launched under the Mars Science Laboratory mission, Curiosity is a car-sized rover equipped with a full laboratory suite. 
    It has been investigating the Gale Crater and has found evidence of habitable environmental conditions in Mars’s past.</li>

    <li></li>Perseverance (2021–present): Part of the Mars 2020 mission, Perseverance is designed to search for signs of ancient life, collect rock and soil samples for future return to Earth, and test new technologies,
    including the Ingenuity helicopter—the first powered flight on another planet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Mars Rover Program has significantly advanced our understanding of Mars and has laid the foundation for future exploration, including human missions. 
    The rovers have sent back high-resolution images, geological data, and climate readings that continue to shape scientific thinking about the Red Planet.</p>
